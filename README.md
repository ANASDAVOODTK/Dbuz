# Dbuz

Project For InOut 7.0 Hackathon by Team **BroCode**.

## Problem Statements

- No **efficient** and **robust** real time crowd monitoring.
- Users can track the **exact location** and **timing** of the bus.
- **Sexual harassments** in public transport remain largely unreported.
- **Cashless transactions** in local public transportation is not possible.

## Solution
Meet our product Dbuz. A smart, secure and streamlined transportation system.

- Users can track the **exact location and timing** of the bus so that there is **no need of spending more time in bus-stops**. This will allow the user to plan their journey more efficiently.
- Using the application, user can check the **crowd density of a particular bus** and can opt a bus which is less or moderately crowded.
- The depots can schedule more buses in routes with higher crowd, and thus generating **more revenue.**
- Makes **reporting of harassment easy**. Smartphone apps and dedicated phone lines can help victims report harassment and other crimes in real time.
- **Cashless transactions** are made available to passengers electronically through e-ticketing. Making the country digitally empowered in the field of technology. #Digital_India.

## Requirements

A mobile phone with Android as OS.

## Technology Stack

- [JAVA](https://java.com/en/) - Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.Used here to develop the Android application.
- [FIREBASE](https://firebase.google.com/) - Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Used here to store data in the cloud
- [IBM ASSISTANT](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/watson-assistant#:~:text=Watson%20Assistant%20is%20IBM's%20AI,any%20application%2C%20device%20or%20channel.) - Watson Assistant was created as a question answering (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning technologies.
- [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features.
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) - Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.
- [Python - OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
- [GPS module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) - The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed from a constellation of 24 satellites and their ground stations. GPS uses these “man-made stars” as reference points to calculate positions accurate to a matter of meters.
- [GSM module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service) - A GSM module or a GPRS module is a chip or circuit that will be used to establish communication between a mobile device or a computing machine and a GSM or GPRS system. The modem (modulator-demodulator) is a critical part here.
- [API Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) - API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
- [Geofencing](https://developers.google.com/location-context/geofencing) - Geofencing combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of the user's proximity to locations that may be of interest. ... The latitude, longitude, and radius define a geofence, creating a circular area, or fence, around the location of interest.
- [Mapbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapbox) - Mapbox is a developer platform used across industries to create custom applications that solve problems with maps, data, and spatial analysis. Mapbox's tools are building blocks that support every part of the web and mobile map-making process

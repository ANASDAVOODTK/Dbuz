- Users can track the exact location and timing of the bus so that there is no need of spending more time in bus-stops. This will allow the user to plan their journey more efficiently.
- Using the application, user can check the crowd density of a particular bus and can opt a bus which is less or moderately crowded.
- The depots can schedule more buses in routes with higher crowd, and thus generating more revenue.
- Make reporting of harassment easy. Smartphone apps and dedicated phone lines can help victims report harassment and other crimes in real time.
- Cashless transactions are made available to passengers electronically through e-ticketing. Making the country digitally empowered in the field of technology. #Digital_India.

# Dbuz

Project For InOut 7.0 Hackathon by Team **BroCode**.

## Problem Statements

- Users cannot track the exact location and timing of the bus.
- No efficient and robust real time crowd monitering.
- Sexual harassments in public transport remain largely unreported.
- Cashless transations.

## Solution
Meet our product Dbuz. A smart, secure and streamlined transportation system.

- Users can track the exact location and timing of the bus so that there is no need of spending more time in bus-stops. This will allow the user to plan their journey more efficiently.
- Using the application, user can check the crowd density of a particular bus and can opt a bus which is less or moderately crowded.
- The depots can schedule more buses in routes with higher crowd, and thus generating more revenue.
- Make reporting of harassment easy. Smartphone apps and dedicated phone lines can help victims report harassment and other crimes in real time.
- Cashless transactions are made available to passengers electronically through e-ticketing. Making the country digitally empowered in the field of technology. #Digital_India.

## Key Features

- Real-time crowd monitoring
- Voice Assistant

## Requirements

A mobile phone with Android as OS.

## Technology Stack

- [JAVA](https://java.com/en/) - Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.Used here to develop the Android application.
- [FIREBASE](https://firebase.google.com/) - Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Used here to store data in the cloud
- [IBM ASSISTANT](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/watson-assistant#:~:text=Watson%20Assistant%20is%20IBM's%20AI,any%20application%2C%20device%20or%20channel.) - Watson Assistant was created as a question answering (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning technologies.
- [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features.
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) - Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.
- [Python - OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
- [GPS module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) - The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed from a constellation of 24 satellites and their ground stations. GPS uses these “man-made stars” as reference points to calculate positions accurate to a matter of meters.
- [GSM module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service) - A GSM module or a GPRS module is a chip or circuit that will be used to establish communication between a mobile device or a computing machine and a GSM or GPRS system. The modem (modulator-demodulator) is a critical part here.
- [API Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) - API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue. js is a progressive framework for JavaScript used to build web interfaces and one-page applications. Not just for web interfaces, Vue. js is also used both for desktop and mobile app development with Electron framework.
- [Geofencing](https://developers.google.com/location-context/geofencing) - Geofencing combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of the user's proximity to locations that may be of interest. ... The latitude, longitude, and radius define a geofence, creating a circular area, or fence, around the location of interest.
